# Final Project Proposal

## [An outstanding Demo Final Project](https://dylanever.itch.io/ibi)

## LMSC-261 recommendations for final projects:
  - [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
  - [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/)
  - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/)
  - Useful databases
  - API interactions
  - Portfolio Website

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Teya's Tasteful Textures!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is to create a live visualizer that reacts to certain parameters of sound and creates an adjacent visual.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be able to react to audio input in real time and create a synced visualizer that can be projected onto me during live performances. I'd like the visualizer to be able to manipulate videos that i've already taken and add cool effects/mess with the data. If I could map the video's quality, color, orientation, etc to react to certain frequencies of audio that would be the dream. If possible ill have the program reacting to the audio output from my computer. Another goal of mine is to have this program run without causing any computer issues/latency. I've decided to try using Python to code along with Pygame and Pyaudio, but if I find out about any better options I would be open to them!

## If you are planning to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Nah

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

With a GOOD outcome I would at least have an audio visualizer that reacts to parameters of audio to create a cool looking thing. Maybe reacting to audio live wont work out, but I think I'll at least have a system to add an audio file and generate an output. I'm also not sure how difficult it would be to have the visualizer distort a previously recorded video, so if that falls through ill still have cool colors going or something.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'm hoping that I'll be able to meet the standard I set in the description of my project above!

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for me would be to add more features to my program. Like maybe I could program the visualizer to react to a certain midi input, giving me more control over the visuals as I perform. I'd also like to build a UI for my program to make it more functional to use.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I'll need to study more about Pygame and Pyaudio, as well as what parameters of audio can be monitored and reacted to in these programs. The same goes for what parameters of video I can manipulate and to what effect. I'll also need to quicken my workflow in python and gain more familiarity with the basic functions of it.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

First, I'll use the official python website for info as well as some helpful blogs ive found and bookmarked. Also, I plan to use the class materials to brush up on python usage. Finally, I'll ask for the help of my friends and partner who study computer science and have taken on similar projects in the past.
