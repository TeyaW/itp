## so! I thought it would be cute to code a little bird into existence.
## I imagined that it would be easy to draw using two ellipses, one large for
## the body and one small for the eye (the bird is looking to the side). Then,
## a thin triangle on its side to make the bird's beak! After drawing my bird
## I assigned x and y values to the grid so I could map the location and size
## of all my shapes moving into phase two. (this was after I took the pic)
