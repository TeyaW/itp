## the first issue i faced in the tiling section of this project was the scale.
## I wanted a 20 x 20 grid on a canvas of 400x400. By writing the scale
## perimeter as .1, i was able to shrink my drawing down to one tenth of its
## size. then, i used two nested for-loops to draw my bird repeatedly down the
## x and y axis. Using the in range function allowed me to put a limit on the
## drawings such that it wouldn't be drawn outside of the canvas.
