## the process of translating my sketch to processing.py went fairly smoothly!
## I had some initial trouble with the orientation of the triangle, because i
## tried to rotate the form of the triangle rather than just specifying the
## three points as they would be with the triangle's sideways orientation.
## To change the fill color of the eyes to white, i wrote fill(225) before the
## command to draw the circle. I was able to find the value to type for white
## by using the processing.org reference page, where it specifies that the
## default color mode for processing is RGB, as opposed to HSB.
